# Statistical analysis of kinetic parameter data from the BRENDA database

This paper presents a range of multilevel Bayesian linear models describing
kinetic parameter data from the online database BRENDA. We assess the models'
qualitative fit to the available data and quantitatively compare their
out-of-sample predictive performance. The best model is shown to compare
favourably with the current state of the art, without needing to use costly
external features such as chemical fingerprints. We discuss how the results of
our analysis can be integrated into a kinetic modelling framework.

The data we used can be reviewed on Github and the analysis can be reproduced
using XXX.
