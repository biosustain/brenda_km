To generate the required priors for the model:
Use the file modelquery.csv as input. Run KmProcessing.py and this should generate a file called OUTPUT_FILE.csv with the mu and sigma of the requested distributions.

To plot the comparison between the priors used in the puplished paper and the priors generated from our model:
Run file plotdists in Matlab

To run the case study:
Download in the same folder the files Dataset_S2, DatasetN, RunModel and TrypMet. Open in Matlab the file RunModel and run it.
