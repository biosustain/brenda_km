  abstract = {Predictive biology is the next great chapter in synthetic and systems biology, particularly for microorganisms. Tasks that once seemed infeasible are increasingly being realized such as designing and implementing intricate synthetic gene circuits that perform complex sensing and actuation functions, and assembling multi-species bacterial communities with specific, predefined compositions. These achievements have been made possible by the integration of diverse expertise across biology, physics and engineering, resulting in an emerging, quantitative understanding of biological design. As ever-expanding multi-omic data sets become available, their potential utility in transforming theory into practice remains firmly rooted in the underlying quantitative principles that govern biological systems. In this Review, we discuss key areas of predictive biology that are of growing interest to microbiology, the challenges associated with the innate complexity of microorganisms and the value of quantitative methods in making microbiology more predictable.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, there are a variety of descriptive studies of available clinical data for coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Mathematical modelling and computational simulations are effective tools that help global efforts to estimate key transmission parameters. The model equations often require computational tools and dynamical analysis that play an important role in controlling the disease. This work reviews some models for coronavirus first, that can address important questions about the global health care and suggest important notes. Then, we model the disease as a system of differential equations. We develop previous models for the coronavirus, some key computational simulations and sensitivity analysis are added. Accordingly, the local sensitivities for each model state with respect to the model parameters are computed using three different techniques: non-normalizations, half normalizations and full normalizations. Results based on sensitivity analysis show that almost all model parameters may have role on spreading this virus among susceptible, exposed and quarantined susceptible people. More specifically, communicate rate person-to-person, quarantined exposed rate and transition rate of exposed individuals have an effective role in spreading this disease. One possible solution suggests that healthcare programs should pay more attention to intervention strategies, and people need to self-quarantine that can effectively reduce the disease.},

  abstract = {Background: Pseudomonas putida is a promising candidate for the industrial production of biofuels and biochemicals because of its high tolerance to toxic compounds and its ability to grow on a wide variety of substrates. Engineering this organism for improved performances and predicting metabolic responses upon genetic perturbations requires reliable descriptions of its metabolism in the form of stoichiometric and kinetic models. Results: In this work, we developed kinetic models of P. putida to predict the metabolic phenotypes and design metabolic engineering interventions for the production of biochemicals. The developed kinetic models contain 775 reactions and 245 metabolites. Furthermore, we introduce here a novel set of constraints within thermodynamics-based flux analysis that allow for considering concentrations of metabolites that exist in several compartments as separate entities. We started by a gap-filling and thermodynamic curation of iJN1411, the genome-scale model of P. putida KT2440. We then systematically reduced the curated iJN1411 model, and we created three core stoichiometric models of different complexity that describe the central carbon metabolism of P. putida. Using the medium complexity core model as a scaffold, we generated populations of large-scale kinetic models for two studies. In the first study, the developed kinetic models successfully captured the experimentally observed metabolic responses to several single-gene knockouts of a wild-type strain of P. putida KT2440 growing on glucose. In the second study, we used the developed models to propose metabolic engineering interventions for improved robustness of this organism to the stress condition of increased ATP demand. Conclusions: The study demonstrates the potential and predictive capabilities of the kinetic models that allow for rational design and optimization of recombinant P. putida strains for improved production of biofuels and biochemicals. The curated genome-scale model of P. putida together with the developed large-scale stoichiometric and kinetic models represents a significant resource for researchers in industry and academia.},

  abstract = {Finding optimal parameters for simulating biological systems is usually a very difficult and expensive task in systems biology. Brute force searching is infeasible in practice because of the huge (often infinite) search space. In this article, we propose predicting the parameters efficiently by learning the relationship between system outputs and parameters using regression. However, the conventional parametric regression models suffer from two issues, thus are not applicable to this problem. First, restricting the regression function as a certain fixed type (e.g. linear, polynomial, etc.) introduces too strong assumptions that reduce the model flexibility. Second, conventional regression models fail to take into account the fact that a fixed parameter value may correspond to multiple different outputs due to the stochastic nature of most biological simulations, and the existence of a potentially large number of other factors that affect the simulation outputs. We propose a novel approach based on a Gaussian process model that addresses the two issues jointly. We apply our approach to a tumor vessel growth model and the feedback Wright\textendash Fisher model. The experimental results show that our method can predict the parameter values of both of the two models with high accuracy. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Multi-parameter models in systems biology are typically `sloppy': some parameters or combinations of parameters may be hard to estimate from data, whereas others are not. One might expect that parameter uncertainty automatically leads to uncertain predictions, but this is not the case. We illustrate this by showing that the prediction uncertainty of each of six sloppy models varies enormously among different predictions. Statistical approximations of parameter uncertainty may lead to dramatic errors in prediction uncertainty estimation. We argue that prediction uncertainty assessment must therefore be performed on a per-prediction basis using a full computational uncertainty analysis. In practice this is feasible by providing a model with a sample or ensemble representing the distribution of its parameters. Within a Bayesian framework, such a sample may be generated by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that infers the parameter distribution based on experimental data. Matlab code for generating the sample (with the Differential Evolution Markov Chain sampler) and the subsequent uncertainty analysis using such a sample, is supplied as Supplemental Information.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen much interest in the study of systems characterized by multiple interacting components. A class of statistical models called graphical models, in which graphs are used to represent probabilistic relationships between variables, provides a framework for formal inference regarding such systems. In many settings, the object of inference is the network structure itself. This problem of ``network inference'' is well known to be a challenging one. However, in scientific settings there is very often existing information regarding network connectivity. A natural idea then is to take account of such information during inference. This article addresses the question of incorporating prior information into network inference. We focus on directed models called Bayesian networks, and use Markov chain Monte Carlo to draw samples from posterior distributions over network structures. We introduce prior distributions on graphs capable of capturing information regarding network features including edges, classes of edges, degree distributions, and sparsity. We illustrate our approach in the context of systems biology, applying our methods to network inference in cancer signaling.},

Here we provide a deep learning approach to predict kcat values for metabolic enzymes in a high-throughput manner with the input of substrate structures and protein sequences. Our approach can capture kcat changes for mutated enzymes and identify amino acid residues with great impact on kcat values. Furthermore, we applied the approach to predict genome scale kcat values for over 300 yeast species, demonstrating that the predicted kcat values are consistent with current evolutional understanding. Additionally, we designed an automatic pipeline using the predicted kcat values to parameterize enzyme-constrained genome scale metabolic models (ecGEMs) facilitated by a Bayesian approach, which outperformed the default ecGEMs in predicting phenotypes and proteomes and enabled to explain phenotype differences among yeast species. The deep learning kcat prediction approach and automatic ecGEM construction pipeline would thus be a valuable tool to uncover the global trend of enzyme kinetics and physiological diversity, and to further elucidate cell metabolism on a large scale.},

The main part contains {$>$}5 million data for {$\sim$}90 000 enzymes from {$\sim$}13 000 organisms, manually extracted from {$\sim$}157 000 primary literature references, combined with information of text and data mining, data integration, and prediction algorithms. Supplements comprise disease-related data, protein sequences, 3D structures, genome annotations, ligand information, taxonomic, bibliographic, and kinetic data. BRENDA offers an easy access to enzyme information from quick to advanced searches, text- and structured-based queries for enzyme-ligand interactions, word maps, and visualization of enzyme data. The BRENDA Pathway Maps are completely revised and updated for an enhanced interactive and intuitive usability. The new design of the Enzyme Summary Page provides an improved access to each individual enzyme. A new protein structure 3D viewer was integrated. The prediction of the intracellular localization of eukaryotic enzymes has been implemented. The new EnzymeDetector combines BRENDA enzyme annotations with protein and genome databases for the detection of eukaryotic and prokaryotic enzymes.},

In 2020, Expasy was redesigned through a user-centric approach, known as User-Centred Design (UCD), whose aim is to create user interfaces that are easy-to-use, efficient and targeting the intended community. This approach, widely used in other fields such as marketing, e-commerce, and design of mobile applications, is still scarcely explored in bioinformatics. In total, around 50 people were actively involved, including internal stakeholders and end-users. In addition to an optimised interface that meets users' needs and expectations, the new version of Expasy provides an up-to-date and accurate description of high-quality resources based on a standardised ontology, allowing to connect functionally-related resources.},

Inference is addressed from a Bayesian perspective, and model comparison is conducted using Bayes factors. Particular attention is paid to prior elicitation and posterior propriety. We suggest priors that require little subjective input and have hierarchical structures that enhance inference robustness.

  abstract = {The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) implement functions to easily build Bayesian models together with efficient automatic inference methods. This helps separate the model building from the inference, allowing practitioners to focus on their specific problems and leaving PPLs to handle the computational details for them (Bessiere, Mazer, Ahuactzin, \& Mekhnacha, 2013; Daniel Roy, 2015; Ghahramani, 2015). The inference process generates a posterior distribution \textemdash{} which has a central role in Bayesian statistics \textemdash{} together with other distributions like the posterior predictive distribution and the prior predictive distribution. The correct visualization, analysis, and interpretation of these distributions is key to properly answer the questions that motivate the inference process.},

In this paper we show that the convergence diagnostic R\textasciicircum{} of Gelman and Rubin (1992) has serious flaws. Traditional R\textasciicircum{} will fail to correctly diagnose convergence failures when the chain has a heavy tail or when the variance varies across the chains. In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles. We suggest that common trace plots should be replaced with rank plots from multiple chains. Finally, we give recommendations for how these methods should be used in practice.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},
